He wanted to end 
<br>sanctions while preserving the capability to reconstitute his weapons of mass destruction (WMD) when 
<br>sanctions were lifted.
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:72px; top:1068px; width:465px; height:72px;"><span style="font-family: IOADAF+Times-Roman; font-size:8px">(cid:127)  </span><span style="font-family: IOADGF+Times-BoldItalic; font-size:8px">Saddam totally dominated the Regime’s strategic decision making.</span><span style="font-family: IOADAF+Times-Roman; font-size:8px"> He initiated most of the strategic 
<br>thinking upon which decisions were made, whether in matters of war and peace (such as invading Kuwait), 
<br>maintaining WMD as a national strategic goal, or on how Iraq was to position itself in the international com-
<br>munity. Loyal dissent was discouraged and constructive variations to the implementation of his wishes on 
<br>strategic issues were rare. Saddam was the Regime in a strategic sense and his intent became Iraq’s strategic 
<br>policy.
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:72px; top:1152px; width:468px; height:72px;"><span style="font-family: IOADAF+Times-Roman; font-size:8px">(cid:127)  </span><span style="font-family: IOADGF+Times-BoldItalic; font-size:8px">Saddam’s primary goal from 1991 to 2003 was to have UN sanctions lifted, while maintaining the security 
<br></span><span style="font-family: IOADGF+Times-BoldItalic; font-size:8px">of the Regime. </span><span style="font-family: IOADAF+Times-Roman; font-size:8px">He sought to balance the need to cooperate with UN inspections—to gain support for lifting 
<br></span><span style="font-family: IOADAF+Times-Roman; font-size:8px">sanctions—with his intention to preserve Iraq’s intellectual capital for WMD with a minimum of foreign 
<br>intrusiveness and loss of face. Indeed, this remained the goal to the end of the Regime, as the starting of any 
<br>WMD program, conspicuous or otherwise, risked undoing the progress achieved in eroding sanctions and 
<br>jeopardizing a political end to the embargo and international monitoring.
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:72px; top:1236px; width:470px; height:48px;"><span style="font-family: IOADAF+Times-Roman; font-size:8px">(cid:127)  </span><span style="font-family: IOADGF+Times-BoldItalic; font-size:8px">The introduction of the Oil-For-Food program (OFF) in late 1996 was a key turning point for the Regime.</span><span style="font-family: IOADAF+Times-Roman; font-size:8px"> 
<br>OFF rescued Baghdad’s economy from a terminal decline created by sanctions. The Regime quickly came 
<br>to see that OFF could be corrupted to acquire foreign exchange both to further undermine sanctions and to 
<br>provide the means to enhance dual-use infrastructure and potential WMD-related development.
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:72px; top:1296px; width:452px; height:36px;"><span style="font-family: IOADAF+Times-Roman; font-size:8px">(cid:127)  </span><span style="font-family: IOADGF+Times-BoldItalic; font-size:8px">By 2000-2001, Saddam had managed to mitigate many of the effects of sanctions and undermine their 
<br>international support.</span><span style="font-family: IOADAF+Times-Roman; font-size:8px"> Iraq was within striking distance of a </span><span style="font-family: IOADJF+Times-Italic; font-size:8px">de facto</span><span style="font-family: IOADAF+Times-Roman; font-size:8px"> end to the sanctions regime, both in 
<br>terms of oil exports and the trade embargo, by the end of 1999.
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:72px; top:1344px; width:469px; height:59px;"><span style="font-family: IOADGF+Times-BoldItalic; font-size:8px">Saddam wanted to recreate Iraq’s WMD capability—which was essentially destroyed in 1991—after sanc-
<br>tions were removed and Iraq’s economy stabilized, but probably with a different mix of capabilities to that 
<br>which previously existed. Saddam aspired to develop a nuclear capability—in an incremental fashion, 
<br>irrespective of international pressure and the resulting economic risks—but he intended to focus on ballistic 
<br>missile and tactical chemical warfare (CW) capabilities.
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:72px; top:1411px; width:468px; height:36px;"><span style="font-family: IOADAF+Times-Roman; font-size:8px">(cid:127)  </span><span style="font-family: IOADGF+Times-BoldItalic; font-size:8px">Iran was the pre-eminent motivator of this policy.</span><span style="font-family: IOADAF+Times-Roman; font-size:8px"> All senior level Iraqi ofﬁ cials considered Iran to be Iraq’s 
<br>principal enemy in the region. The wish to balance Israel and acquire status and inﬂ uence in the Arab world 
<br>were also considerations, but secondary.
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:72px; top:1459px; width:467px; height:72px;"><span style="font-family: IOADAF+Times-Roman; font-size:8px">(cid:127)  </span><span style="font-family: IOADGF+Times-BoldItalic; font-size:8px">Iraq Survey Group (ISG) judges that events in the 1980s and early 1990s shaped Saddam’s belief in the 
<br>value of WMD. </span><span style="font-family: IOADAF+Times-Roman; font-size:8px">In Saddam’s view, WMD helped to save the Regime multiple times. He believed that during 
<br>the Iran-Iraq war chemical weapons had halted Iranian ground offensives and that ballistic missile attacks 
<br>on Tehran had broken its political will. Similarly, during Desert Storm, Saddam believed WMD had deterred 
<br>Coalition Forces from pressing their attack beyond the goal of freeing Kuwait. WMD had even played a role 
<br>in crushing the Shi’a revolt in the south following the 1991 cease-ﬁ re.

<br></span><span style="font-family: IOADAF+Times-Roman; font-size:8px">was there an identiﬁ able group of WMD policy makers or planners separate from Saddam. Instead, his lieu-
<br></span><span style="font-family: IOADAF+Times-Roman; font-size:8px">tenants understood WMD revival was his goal from their long association with Saddam and his infrequent, 
<br>but ﬁ rm, verbal comments and directions to them.

<br>ligence structures were critical to ISG’s assessment of the former Regime’s WMD strategy. </span><span style="font-family: IOADJF+Times-Italic; font-size:8px">While some 
<br>detainees’ statements were made to minimize their involvement or culpability leading to potential prosecution, 
<br>in some cases those who were interviewed spoke relatively candidly and at length about the Regime’s strategic 
<br>intent.
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:72px; top:1931px; width:463px; height:35px;"><span style="font-family: IOADAF+Times-Roman; font-size:8px">(cid:127)  </span><span style="font-family: IOADJF+Times-Italic; font-size:8px">ISG analysts—because of unprecedented access to detainees—undertook interviews of national policy 
<br>makers, the leadership of the intelligence and security services, and Qusay’s inner circle, as well as concen-
<br>trated debriefs of core Regime leaders in custody, to identify cross-Regime issues and perceptions. 
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:72px; top:1979px; width:465px; height:71px;"><span style="font-family: IOADAF+Times-Roman; font-size:8px">(cid:127)  </span><span style="font-family: IOADJF+Times-Italic; font-size:8px">As part of the effort aimed at the core leadership, analysts also gave detainees “homework” to give them 
<br>more opportunity to discuss in writing various aspects of former Regime strategy. Many of these responses 
<br></span><span style="font-family: IOADJF+Times-Italic; font-size:8px">were lengthy and detailed. Secretary of the President, ‘Abd Hamid Al Khatab Al Nasiri, Deputy Prime 
<br></span><span style="font-family: IOADJF+Times-Italic; font-size:8px">Minister Tariq ‘Aziz ‘Aysa, and Minister of Military Industry ‘Abd-al-Tawab ‘Abdallah Al Mullah Huwaysh 
<br>answered questions in writing several times, providing information on both the former Regime and the mind-
<br>set of those who ran it.
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:72px; top:2063px; width:450px; height:35px;"><span style="font-family: IOADAF+Times-Roman; font-size:8px">(cid:127)  </span><span style="font-family: IOADJF+Times-Italic; font-size:8px">Saddam’s debriefer was fully aware of ISG’s information needs and developed a strategy to elicit candid 
<br>answers and insights into Saddam’s personality and role in strategy-related issues. Remarks from the 
<br>debriefer are included.
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:72px; top:2111px; width:455px; height:35px;"><span style="font-family: IOADAF+Times-Roman; font-size:8px">(cid:127)  </span><span style="font-family: IOADJF+Times-Italic; font-size:8px">Analysts also used working groups to study themes and trends—such as intelligence and security service 
<br>activity, weaponization, dual-use/break-out capabilities and timeline analysis—that cut across ISG’s func-
<br>tional teams, as well as to pool efforts to debrief members of the core leadership.
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:72px; top:2159px; width:468px; height:71px;"><span style="font-family: IOADGF+Times-BoldItalic; font-size:8px">Analysts used subsource development and document exploitation to crosscheck detainee testimony, lever-
<br>age detainees in debriefs, and to ﬁ ll gaps in information. </span><span style="font-family: IOADJF+Times-Italic; font-size:8px">For example, analysts interviewing Huwaysh gained 
<br>insights into his personality from subsources, while translated technical and procurement-related documents 
<br>were critical to verifying the accuracy of his testimony. Likewise, we confronted Vice President Taha Yasin 
<br>Ramadan Al Jizrawi with a captured document indicating his major role in allocating oil contracts and he 
<br>divulged details on corruption stemming from the UN’s OFF program.
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:72px; top:2238px; width:467px; height:95px;"><span style="font-family: IOADGF+Times-BoldItalic; font-size:8px">Nonetheless, the interview process had several shortcomings. </span><span style="font-family: IOADJF+Times-Italic; font-size:8px">Detainees were very concerned about their fate 
<br>and therefore would not be willing to implicate themselves in sensitive matters of interest such as WMD, in 
<br></span><span style="font-family: IOADJF+Times-Italic; font-size:8px">light of looming prosecutions. Debriefers noted the use of passive interrogation resistance techniques collec-
<br></span><span style="font-family: IOADJF+Times-Italic; font-size:8px">tively by a large number of detainees to avoid their involvement or knowledge of sensitive issues; place blame 
<br>or knowledge with individuals who were not in a position to contradict the detainee’s statements, such as 
<br>deceased individuals or individuals who were not in custody or who had ﬂ ed the country; and provide debrief-
<br>ers with previously known information. However, the reader should keep in mind the Arab proverb: “Even a 
<br>liar tells many truths.”
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:72px; top:2342px; width:466px; height:59px;"><span style="font-family: IOADJF+Times-Italic; font-size:8px">Some former Regime ofﬁ cials, such as ‘Ali Hasan Al Majid Al Tikriti (Chemical ‘Ali), never gave substantial 
<br>information, despite speaking colorfully and at length. He never discussed actions, which would implicate him 
<br>in a crime. Moreover, for some aspects of the Regime’s WMD strategy, like the role of the Military Industri-
<br>alization Commission (MIC), analysts could only speak with a few senior-level ofﬁ cials, which limited ISG’s 
<br>assessment to the perspectives of these individuals.

<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:71px; top:2706px; width:468px; height:131px;"><span style="font-family: IOADJF+Times-Italic; font-size:8px">The quality of cooperation and assistance provided to ISG by former senior Iraqi Regime ofﬁ cials in custody 
<br>varied widely. Some obstructed all attempts to elicit information on WMD and illicit activities of the former 
<br>Regime. Others, however, were keen to help clarify every issue, sometimes to the point of self-incrimination. 
<br>The two extremes of cooperation are epitomized by ‘Ali Hasan Al Majid—a key Presidential Adviser and RCC 
<br>member—and Sabir ‘Abd-al-Aziz Husayn Al Duri, a former Lieutenant General who served in both the Direc-
<br>torate of General Military Intelligence and the Iraqi Intelligence Service. ‘Ali Hasan Al Majid was loquacious 
<br>on many subjects, but remained adamant in denying any involvement in the use of CW in attacks on the Kurds 
<br>and dissembling in any discussion of the subject. His circumlocution extends to most other sensitive subjects of 
<br>Regime behavior. By contrast, Sabir has been forthcoming to the point of direct association with a wide range 
<br>of Iraqi activities, including the management of Kuwaiti prisoners, the organization of assassinations abroad 
<br>by the former Iraqi Intelligence Service (IIS), and the torture of political prisoners.

<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:72px; top:4393px; width:465px; height:59px;"><span style="font-family: IOADAF+Times-Roman; font-size:8px">Throughout the 1990s and up to OIF (March 2003), Saddam focused on one set of objectives: the survival of 
<br>himself, his Regime, and his legacy. To secure those objectives, Saddam needed to exploit Iraqi oil assets, to 
<br>portray a strong military capability to deter internal and external threats, and to foster his image as an Arab 
<br>leader. Saddam recognized that the reconstitution of Iraqi WMD enhanced both his security and image. Conse-
<br>quently, Saddam needed to end UN-imposed sanctions to fulﬁ  ll his goals. 
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:72px; top:4460px; width:466px; height:107px;"><span style="font-family: IOADAF+Times-Roman; font-size:8px">Saddam severely under estimated the economic and military costs of invading Iran in 1980 and Kuwait in 
<br>1990, as well as underestimating the subsequent international condemnation of his invasion of Kuwait. He did 
<br>not anticipate this condemnation, nor the subsequent imposition, comprehensiveness, severity, and longev-
<br>ity of UN sanctions. His initial belief that UN sanctions would not last, resulting in his country’s economic 
<br>decline, changed by 1998 when the UNSC did not lift sanctions after he believed resolutions were fulﬁ lled. 
<br>Although Saddam had reluctantly accepted the UN’s Oil for Food (OFF) program by 1996, he soon recog-
<br>nized its economic value and additional opportunities for further manipulation and inﬂ uence of the UNSC Iraq 
<br></span><span style="font-family: IOADAF+Times-Roman; font-size:8px">661 Sanctions Committee member states. Therefore, he resigned himself to the continuation of UN sanctions 
<br>understanding that they would become a “paper tiger” regardless of continued US resolve to maintain them. 
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:72px; top:4575px; width:466px; height:59px;"><span style="font-family: IOADAF+Times-Roman; font-size:8px">Throughout sanctions, Saddam continually directed his advisors to formulate and implement strategies, poli-
<br>cies, and methods to terminate the UN’s sanctions regime established by UNSCR 661. The Regime devised an 
<br>effective diplomatic and economic strategy of generating revenue and procuring illicit goods utilizing the Iraqi 
<br>intelligence, banking, industrial, and military apparatus that eroded United Nations’ member states and other 
<br>international players’ resolve to enforce compliance, while capitalizing politically on its humanitarian crisis. 
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:72px; top:4643px; width:453px; height:59px;"><span style="font-family: IOADAF+Times-Roman; font-size:8px">•  From Saddam’s perspective, UN sanctions hindered his ability to rule Iraq with complete authority and 
<br>autonomy. In the long run, UN sanctions also interfered with his efforts to establish a historic legacy. 
<br></span><span style="font-family: IOADGF+Times-BoldItalic; font-size:8px">According to Saddam and his senior advisors, the UN, at the behest of the US, placed an economic 
<br>strangle hold on Iraq</span><span style="font-family: IOADAF+Times-Roman; font-size:8px">. The UN controlled Saddam’s main source of revenue (oil exports) and determined 
<br>what Iraq could import. 
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:72px; top:4715px; width:469px; height:35px;"><span style="font-family: IOADAF+Times-Roman; font-size:8px">•  UN sanctions curbed Saddam’s ability to import weapons, technology, and expertise into Iraq. Sanctions also 
<br>limited his ability to ﬁ nance his military, intelligence, and security forces to deal with his perceived and real 
<br>external threats. 
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:72px; top:4763px; width:461px; height:47px;"><span style="font-family: IOADAF+Times-Roman; font-size:8px">•  In short, Saddam considered UN sanctions as a form of economic war and the UN’s OFF program and 
<br>Northern and Southern Watch Operations as campaigns of that larger economic war orchestrated by the US 
<br>and UK. His evolving strategy centered on breaking free of UN sanctions in order to liberate his economy 
<br>from the economic strangle-hold so he could continue to pursue his political and personal objectives. 
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:72px; top:4823px; width:469px; height:95px;"><span style="font-family: IOADAF+Times-Roman; font-size:8px">One aspect of Saddam’s strategy of unhinging the UN’s sanctions against Iraq, centered on Saddam’s efforts 
<br>to inﬂ uence certain UN SC permanent members, such as Russia, France, and China and some nonpermanent 
<br>(Syria, Ukraine) members to end UN sanctions. </span><span style="font-family: IOADGF+Times-BoldItalic; font-size:8px">Under Saddam’s orders, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs 
<br>(MFA) formulated and implemented a strategy aimed at these UNSC members and international public 
<br>opinion with the purpose of ending UN sanctions and undermining its subsequent OFF program by diplo-
<br>matic and economic means. </span><span style="font-family: IOADAF+Times-Roman; font-size:8px">At a minimum, Saddam wanted to divide the ﬁ ve permanent members and foment 
<br>international public support of Iraq at the UN and throughout the world by a savvy public relations campaign 
<br>and an extensive diplomatic effort.  
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:72px; top:4926px; width:466px; height:71px;"><span style="font-family: IOADAF+Times-Roman; font-size:8px">Another element of this strategy involved circumventing UN sanctions and the OFF program by means of 
<br>“Protocols” or government-to-government economic trade agreements. Protocols allowed Saddam to gener-
<br>ate a large amount of revenue outside the purview of the UN. The successful implementation of the Protocols, 
<br>continued oil smuggling efforts, and the manipulation of UN OFF contracts emboldened Saddam to pursue his 
<br>military reconstitution efforts starting in 1997 and peaking in 2001. These efforts covered conventional arms, 
<br></span><span style="font-family: IOADAF+Times-Roman; font-size:8px">dual-use goods acquisition, and some WMD-related programs.

<br>governments, devised and implemented methods and techniques to procure illicit goods from foreign suppli-
<br>ers. 
<br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:72px; top:5256px; width:465px; height:59px;"><span style="font-family: IOADAF+Times-Roman; font-size:8px">•  To implement its procurement efforts, Iraq under Saddam, created a network of Iraqi front companies, some 
<br>with close relationships to high-ranking foreign government ofﬁ cials. These foreign government ofﬁ cials, in 
<br>turn, worked through their respective ministries, state-run companies and ministry-sponsored front compa-
<br>nies, to procure illicit goods, services, and technologies for Iraq’s WMD-related, conventional arms, and/or 
<br>dual-use goods programs.

<br>amassed more that $11 billion from the early 1990s to OIF outside the UN-approved methods</span><span style="font-family: IOADAF+Times-Roman; font-size:8px">. The most 
<br>proﬁ  table stream concerned Protocols or government-to-government agreements that generated over $7.5 
<br>billion for Saddam. Iraq earned an additional $2 billion from kickbacks or surcharges associated with the 
<br>UN’s OFF program; $990 million from oil “cash sales” or smuggling; and another $230 million from other 
<br></span><span style="font-family: IOADAF+Times-Roman; font-size:8px">surcharge impositions.

<br>policies, and techniques to discredit the UN sanctions, harass UN personnel in Iraq, and discredit the US. At 
<br>the same time, according to reporting, he also wanted to obfuscate Iraq’s refusal to reveal the nature of its 
<br>WMD and WMD-related programs, their capabilities, and his intentions.

<br>humanitarian plight, and increased complicity by Iraqi’s neighbors led elements within Saddam’s Regime to 
<br>boast that the UN sanctions were slowly eroding. In July 2000, the ruling Iraqi Ba’athist paper, Al-Thawrah, 
<br>claimed victory over UN sanctions, stating that Iraq was accelerating its pace to develop its national economy 
<br>despite the UN “blockade.” In August 2001, Iraqi Foreign Minister Sabri stated in an Al-Jazirah TV interview 
<br></span><span style="font-family: IOADAF+Times-Roman; font-size:8px">that UN sanctions efforts had collapsed at the same time Baghdad had been making steady progress on its eco-

Nev-
<br>ertheless, after 1996 Iraq still had a signiﬁ cant dual-use capability—some declared—readily useful for BW 
<br></span><span style="font-family: IOADGF+Times-BoldItalic; font-size:8px">if the Regime chose to use it to pursue a BW program. Moreover, Iraq still possessed its most important BW

<br>The years following Desert Storm wrought a steady degradation of Iraq’s industrial base: new equipment

<br>if they required special foreign equipment and expertise, would attract international attention. UN monitor-
<br>ing of dual-use facilities up to the end of 1998, made their use for clandestine purpose complicated and risk 
<br>laden.

Although 
<br>equipment and facilities were destroyed under UN supervision in 1996, Iraq retained technical BW know-
<br>how through the scientists that were involved in the former program. ISG has also identiﬁ ed civilian facilities 
<br>and equipment in Iraq that have dual-use application that could be used for the production of agent.

<br>and probably destroyed remaining holdings of bulk BW agent. However ISG lacks evidence to document 
<br>complete destruction. Iraq retained some BW-related seed stocks until their discovery after Operation Iraqi 
<br>Freedom (OIF).

<br>to declare the offensive BW program and in consequence ordered all evidence of the program erased. Iraq 
<br>declared that BW program personnel sanitized the facilities and destroyed the weapons and their contents.

ISG 
<br>assesses that the evidence for the original number of bombs is uncertain. ISG judges that Iraq clandestinely 
<br>destroyed at least 132 bombs and 25 missiles. ISG continued the efforts of the UN at the destruction site but 
<br>found no remnants of further weapons. This leaves the possibility that the fragments of up to 25 bombs may 
<br>remain undiscovered. Of these, any that escaped destruction would probably now only contain degraded
